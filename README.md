## Hi there, I am Adrian 👋

My background is i.a. in business-, bio- and neuroinformatics.  
I enjoy abstract thinking or planning, optimizing all the things for efficiency as well as automating what can feasibly be automated.


My drive is to eventually take part in enabling novel communication methods via Brain Computer Interfaces to increase communication speed, quality and scope thereby enhancing learning rate and education levels, among other things.
___

- Master's degree in bioinformatics, thesis about neuronal simulations.
- Bachelor's degree in business informatics, thesis about Word2Vec (pre-transformer era embeddings).
- Personal passion in AI opportunities and its applications in science, particularly in life sciences.
- I played the game before GPT models released.
