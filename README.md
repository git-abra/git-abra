## Hi there, I am Adrian 👋

My background is in business-, bio- and neuroinformatics.  
I enjoy abstract thinking or planning, optimizing all the things for efficiency as well as automating what can feasibly be automated.
My ultimate drive is to take part in enabling new communication methods via Brain Computer Interfaces to increase 
communication speed and quality, learning rate and education level.
___

- Master's degree in bioinformatics, thesis about neuronal simulations.
- Bachelor's degree in business informatics, thesis about Word2Vec (pre-transformer era embeddings).
- Personal passion in AI opportunities and its applications in science, particularly in life sciences.
- I played the game before GPT models released.
